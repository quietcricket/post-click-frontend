Instead, it’s in overdrive calculating the exact amount of sleep you’ll get if you fall asleep this very second. There’s nothing left to do but stare at your phone and incessantly refresh your social feeds. Or stare at cracks in the ceiling. Right? Wrong. Slow your mind down with the soothing pitter patter of Night Rain."
